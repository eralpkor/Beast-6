<!-- In AccountingJS 13, we looked at accounting.toFixed method. We found that we could improve the function by simulating calculations like 1.005 * 100 with 1.005e2 (using exponential notation).

Your job is to rewrite accounting.toFixed so that it does NOT use multiplication or exponential notation. Instead, you will actually move the decimal point using string manipulation.

So in the example above, instead of using 1.005e2, you'll need to figure out a way to work with the string "1.005" and then create a new string with the decimal point moved over two places to the right. In other words, you need to turn "1.005" into "100.5" using string manipulation.

Include tests that cover the weird cases we saw in the video like 0.615, 10.235, and 1.005.

This is more of a fun exercise than a practical solution since exponential notation works fine, but it's a great way to force you to learn about string manipulation. It also helps to reinforce what you've learned, so I'll take it :)

Also if you didn't know about exponential notation, this would be a great approach. So this is a good way to see how to a problem from a different angle. -->

function mytoFixed(number, precision) {
  precision = Math.round()
}





describe('1.005" into "100.5" using string manipulation', function() {
  it('1. Should round up the number.', function() {
    expect(mytoFixed(0.429, 2)).toBe('0.43');
  });
});
